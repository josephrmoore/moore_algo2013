Week 1: 

rectangleTest

All the sketches are here, use A, B, C, D, E, & F to switch between them. 

Flipbook

Digitized video version is in the repo: beyourself.mov
(But I made it and can show it to you in person if you like.)

Week 2:

Gravity (gravity)
BleedingCanvas (background autoclear doodling tool)
3DBox (sphere bouncing in 3d box)

Videos

I took 3 videos and sketched out the motion lines on paper while watching them. I have the paper and can show you. I will photograph them and upload them with the videos.

Week 3:

Bouncer (natural phenomenon - image bouncers.jpg in the project folder)
Chores (musical accompaniment)
Ico (atan2 follow)
SinSquared (Whitney)

Week 4:

Finished Whitney last week
PiratePad updated
OF->Processing => line_creature (OF sketch to Processing)
Fireworks

Video is in the repo: particlesystem.mov

Week 5:

ParticleControl (use 1,2,3 to see the settings change at runtime)
<!-- :::I don't like what I've done here. I need to see you about images.::: -->
ParticleSinCos
Advanced::ParticleDraw

Paper
Read it. Loved it. Gonna use it in my thesis. Thanks. The system I wrote about is in the folder WRITING, called Emergent Music.

Week 6:

SolitaireEnding - A literal interpretation which inspired...
SolitaireEndingAbstract - I think of it as Impressionist Rain
Attraction - Use 1,2,3,4,5 to control the experience
StrangeAttractorOwen - I didn't "do" this assignment as attempt to do a couple things and modified Owen's beautiful work

Week 7:

UndulatingCircles_Kim - I took Alberts circles sketch and tried to make a class out of it in the hopes of getting many undulating circles
VectorFields - I used corners & sin for circles

Week 8:

Steering - I got many cars (kinda) avoiding each other and it looks suspiciously like flocking. However, if I make too many, they disappear into a black hole. Problem? 
VectorFields1 - I copied your base code in and am not feeling inspired. Will work on later.
VectorFields2 - Still blank. Again. Later. Sorry. Sleepy.

Week 9:

Non-code:

WRITING/animation_videos.txt

Code:

Looping composition - I made a digital space and character for my thesis project and I chose to use it to embody some of these animation prinicples in my sprite. I used squash and stretch and also arc to swing the arms. I drew the bot once in illustrator for each direction, then copied it 8 times across to make 8 frames in the sprite for each direction for a total of 32 bots. I then changed each one in sequence to get the walk cycle I wanted. The image files are IMAGES/badideabot.png and IMAGES/badideabot.ai. You can see the animation live at http://badideabot.com/prototype2

SquashNStretch - I got the suash and stretch going but it knocked the timing off the collision. I tried to use atan2 to rotate the particles toward the circle wall they collide with but i couldn't get the destination point correct.


Week 10:

Million Particle Summer
Timestep Abstract Solitaire

Week 11:

Duration Project is in the DURATION folder. oF project that goes with it labelled "week_11_Duration". This is the Advanced version, i did multiples from the getgo.
